Hello, My name is kain, at lest that's what I go by.

I'm making these guides as a way not only for me to learn more but also to help others that want to learn said languages can learn it.
I do make everything in "Visual Studio Code" as I thought it would be the most accessable and lightweight for at least makig this, I'll
have everything sectioned as best I can, however I will be slow as I am busy with things, however I'll try to get things done as fast 
as I possibly can, so thank you for your patience.

if you stayed to read this to the end, Thank you, I hope you enjoy the guides.
