    In order to store numbers/Integers, we need to choose the right type of Variable.

    Doing this is pretty straightforward. This way of doing it is called "Declaration",
    and for the purposes of this, we'll use the keyword "int" [yes it has to be lowercase],
    for this section

    In C#, when you load up a solution as a "C#" in Visual Studio [the puple one] it'll
    be ready for use with other things, but we'll focus on just declaration.

    You can see how to declare a variable in "variableExample.cs" file, but to make this
    easier, it's done like so:

            int a;

    if you looked at the code, you'll see that there are a lot of things there like 
    "using", "namespace", and "class", don't worry about any of that, you just have
    to look at the declaration. However, let's break it down shall we.

    int - represents the variable type, in this case, Integer

    a - representsthe name of the variable


    Now that we've covered how to declare an Integer, let's assign a value. There are
    two ways to do this in C#, those are:

    - On the same line when declaring a variable
    
    - Assigning later in the code post-declaration

    The values of the variables can be changed throughout the code, this is usefull when 
    having to do operations and so on. 

    Let's see this in code.
