    As we already know, numerical data can be stored in two ways

    - Integers [aka. Whole Numbers]
    - Decimals 

    Simply explained, integers are everything on the left side of the "Decimal point"

    Some examples of integers are:

    - 186468
    - 37886
    - 100

    For Decimals they are some like:

    - 10.00005
    - 12025
    - 1000.1


    Now the question is, where do we store this information?

    Well, as one might have guessed, that would be in a "Variable" ["Var" for a shorter representation]


    Now, what is a variable?

    A Variable, in short, is a container, think of a Bookshelf, or a plastic container 
    to store things in your fridge, the concept is pretty much the same, it's a place that
    you will use to be able to store certain types of information, and in turn, different
    types of information needs different Variables types, such types are:

    - int: Used to store whole/Integer numbers [short for "integer"]

    - double: Used to store decimal numbers/values 

    - char: Used to store a single Character/letter

    - string: Used for storing words or sentances [for example, dialogue]
